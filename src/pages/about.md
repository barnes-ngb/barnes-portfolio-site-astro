# About

I like building *instruments*, not just apps — tools that turn messy physical reality into clear decisions and actions.

## Background

I've spent years at the intersection of **fabrication, geometry, and software** — working on complex architectural metal projects where millimeters matter and field conditions never match the model.

At **Zahner**, I built internal tools that bridge the gap between design intent and field reality: geometry pipelines, deviation analysis, and installer-facing interfaces. This work taught me that the hardest problem isn't detection — it's expressing corrections in a format that field crews can actually execute.

## Philosophy

The tools I build share a common thread:

- **Constraints-aware**: Every correction lives within physical and procedural limits
- **Verification-first**: Before/after metrics that prove the gap is closed
- **Field-executable**: Clear steps, not ambiguous guidance

I believe the best software for physical work acts like a good instrument: precise, reliable, and transparent about what it's measuring.

## Technical

**Languages:** Python, C#, TypeScript
**Domains:** Geometry pipelines, point cloud processing, web 3D viewers, tolerance analysis
**Approach:** Pragmatic automation — solve real problems, ship working tools

## Current focus

Building the **Directive Engine**: a system that converts nominal-vs-as-built deltas into installer-ready directive cards with visualization and verification loops.
