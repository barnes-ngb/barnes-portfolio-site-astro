# About

I like building *instruments*, not just apps — tools that turn messy physical reality into clear decisions and actions.

**Comfortable with:** Python, C#, TypeScript, geometry pipelines, web 3D viewers, pragmatic automation.

**Current focus:** installer directive formats that scale: constraints-aware steps + verification loops.
