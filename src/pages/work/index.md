# Work

A selection of projects spanning directive systems, geometry tools, and architectural fabrication.

---

## Flagship Project

<div class="project-card">

### [Directive Engine](/work/directive-engine/)

Convert nominal ↔ as-built deltas into **installer-ready directive cards** with 3D visualization and verification loops. The core of my current work: bridging detection and execution for field teams.

</div>

---

## Professional Experience

Work from my time at **Zahner**, an architectural metals company known for complex facades and sculptural metalwork. These pages link to public references without re-hosting employer assets.

<div class="project-card">

### [Zahner Labs](/work/zahner-labs/)

Applied R&D projects including SurveyLink (field-to-model alignment), MaterialComposer (finish specification), and geometry pipeline tools.

</div>

<div class="project-card">

### [Amherst College Science Center](/work/amherst-science-center/)

Project engineering for a perforated metal facade system — coordination, tolerances, and installation sequencing.

</div>

<div class="project-card">

### [The Mexican Museum](/work/the-mexican-museum/)

Complex sculptural facade requiring tight geometric control and multi-trade coordination.

</div>

---

## Open Source

<div class="project-card">

### [patina-model](/work/patina-model/)

Python model for predicting patina phase evolution on weathering steel and copper alloys. Used for finish lifecycle planning.
