# Amherst College Science Center (project engineering)

**Role:** Project Engineer (A. Zahner Co.)  
**Public reference:** https://www.azahner.com/profiles/locations/amherst-massachusetts/

## What this is
Zahner engineered, fabricated, and installed a custom Solanum Steel façade system for Amherst College’s Science Center.  
(Details and imagery are on the public reference link.)

## My contributions (replace)
- (ex: coordination across design/engineering/fab/field)
- (ex: part tracking / install sequencing support)
- (ex: quality checks, submittals, RFI workflows)
- (ex: tooling or automation that improved delivery)

## What I’d highlight (public-safe)
- interfaces, tolerances, and installability constraints
- communication formats that reduce rework
- alignment between model intent and site reality
