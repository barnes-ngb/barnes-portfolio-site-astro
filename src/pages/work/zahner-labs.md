# Zahner Labs (public references)

I worked across the Zahner Labs projects listed on Zahner’s public Labs page.
This portfolio page is intentionally **link-out only** (no copied images), and focuses on **my role + what shipped**.

> Replace the “My contributions” bullets below with what you’re comfortable sharing publicly.

### Throughline

Across these Labs projects, the pattern is consistent:

**Measure → Reconcile → Act → Verify**

- **Measure:** capture as-built conditions (survey / scan)
- **Reconcile:** compare to a nominal model using local coordinate systems and tolerances
- **Act:** communicate corrections in a form the field can execute
- **Verify:** confirm closure to tolerance

SurveyLink is publicly described as a real-time link between as-designed models and as-built field data, surfacing deviations for instant feedback. Labs Report 003 describes the bridge between digital and physical as combining capture, tolerance reconciliation, and on-site tools to drive parts toward their modeled position.

Directive Engine is a focused continuation: turning reconciliation output into constrained, step-by-step installer directives plus a verification loop.
