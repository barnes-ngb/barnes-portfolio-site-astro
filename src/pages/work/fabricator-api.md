# Fabricator API

## Problem
Design teams need **fabrication constraints earlier** in the modeling cycle to avoid late-stage rework, value engineering, or downstream constructability surprises.

## Approach
We embedded constraint “bumpers” inside Grasshopper. Rules and geometric relationships encode production constraints so designers get immediate feedback while they explore forms.

## Capabilities
- Surface analysis and curvature checks.
- Panelization guidance with outlier detection.
- Sheet sizing, nesting, and takeoff outputs.
- Panel span and performance sanity checks.

## What shipped
A reusable tool library with a plugin distribution approach that allowed teams to install, update, and standardize constraint checks across projects.

## Collaboration
Built in collaboration with a top-tier architecture firm.

## Notes on rights/credits
No client imagery or proprietary details are shown.
