# patina-model

**Repo:** https://github.com/barnes-ngb/patina-model

A Python package that predicts patina phase evolution using thermodynamics / kinetics primitives.

## What I’d show on a portfolio
- clean package structure + tests
- clear README + quickstart
- extendable data model (more metals, more environments)

## Why it’s relevant to my direction
It’s an example of building **instruments**:
a model with a contract, tests, and an interface that others can build on.
