# The Mexican Museum (project engineering)

**Role:** Project Engineer (A. Zahner Co.)  
**Public reference:** https://www.azahner.com/works/the-mexican-museum/

## What this is
Zahner’s scope included a stainless-steel façade using contrasting finishes (Angel Hair + mirror polish) designed by Jan Hendrix.  
(Details and imagery are on the public reference link.)

## My contributions (replace)
- (ex: engineering coordination + fabrication readiness)
- (ex: install planning / QA)
- (ex: resolving field-fit issues with constrained actions and verification)

## What I’d highlight (public-safe)
- complex surface geometry → manufacture + assembly constraints
- verification and signoff loops
- the importance of “directive-style” communication in the field
