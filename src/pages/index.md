# Nathan Barnes

I build **instruments for physical work** — tools that turn messy field reality into clear, executable decisions.

The hardest part of installing complex assemblies isn't detecting that something is off — it's expressing the correction in a format that's unambiguous, constrained by what's allowed, and verifiable after adjustment.

## Featured Work

<div class="project-card">

### [Directive Engine](/work/directive-engine/)

Convert nominal ↔ as-built deltas into **installer-ready directive cards** (move / rotate / index), with 3D visualization and verification loops.

</div>

## What I Build

**Directive generation** — Actionable correction steps with constraints and tolerances

**3D visualization** — Web-based viewers that make adjustments legible and auditable

**Verification loops** — Before/after deviation checks so teams close the gap with confidence

## Experience

Background in **architectural fabrication** at Zahner, building geometry pipelines, deviation analysis tools, and installer-facing interfaces for complex metal projects.
