## Directive Engine: as-built deltas → installer-ready steps

I build tools that turn **as-built reality** (scan / field capture) into **clear, step-by-step installer directives**:
**move / rotate / index**, with visualization and a verification loop.

- **Flagship:** [Directive Engine](/work/directive-engine/)
- **Public references:** [Zahner Labs work](/work/zahner-labs/) + [Project engineering](/work/amherst-science-center/) / [Mexican Museum](/work/the-mexican-museum/)
- **Open-source:** [patina-model](/work/patina-model/)

## What I build
- **Directive generation**: convert nominal ↔ as-built deltas into actionable steps (constraints + tolerances).
- **3D visualization**: web-based viewers that make adjustments legible and auditable.
- **Verification loop**: “before/after” deviation checks so teams can close the gap with confidence.

## Current focus
This spring I’m shipping a **Directive Engine** demo that bridges the gap between detection (reality capture) and execution (field crews).
